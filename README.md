Don't look at me! I'm just a poor servant 👴🏼. My only meaning is to be a training dummy 🥊🤕.

## Introduction

Praetorian Test Deploy project is mainly used for simulating and testing deployment through a `fabric` library.

## Installation

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our dependencies. Use `poetry install` to create new environment
and install all required dependencies.

## Usage

> Create new folder (e.g. named as project name to be deployed).
> In the folder just create fabfile.py. After that simply run:

- `fab -r ./example_project_name/ deploy temporary@praetorian.sk temp_password`
